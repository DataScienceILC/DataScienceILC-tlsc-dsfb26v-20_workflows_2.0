## General aim of the course

When you program, you seldom program in isolation. Usually, you are writing analyses, pieces of software or creating visualizations within a collaborative (research) project. Adopting a robust and reproducible workflow is key for managing your own work and that of others. Using a version control system, managing your data and other files in a structured way, deploying your software or analysis pipeline in a robust manner are all good practices you need to apply in your work.

In this course we will focus on the tools that are available to adopt such good practices in your own work. Using examples and many exercises and assignments we will help you get to know the tools and workflows that are available to you. In this course we will focus on tools that are open source and freely available. This will greatly facilitate the application and use of these tools outside the course context. Furthermore, open source software is one of the key prerequisites for Open Science. We will start the course by explaining what Open Science is and how it (to our opinion) will lead to better science. We will use this framework to expand our knowledge on how to apply good practices from the software development industry to scientific applications and from there we will gradually start adding tools to your data science toolbox.
